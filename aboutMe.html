I've been involved in programming for over 2 years. I started my career from Java backend and Java related frameworks like Spring and Hibernate. Recently, I have been exploring also frontend technologies with similar commitment, aspiring to become a full stack dev in the relatively near future:) I spend most of my free time on bike or doing workouts. I'm also hanging out with my friends whenever it's possible.</p></section><footer class="footer"><p class="footer__paragraph">&copy Pawel Slupski's website, the website is being developed based on the knowledge acquired during the WTF training: What this frontend?! & Samurai of programming courses. <a class="footer__link" href="#top">Go up</a></p></footer></main></div><script src="aboutMe.022154fc.js"></script><script src="aboutMeStyle.022154fc.js"></script></body></html>
